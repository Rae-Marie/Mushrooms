## About the Collection

This collection consists of illustrations from three different sources: 

  - The herball, or, Generall historie of plantes / gathered by John Gerarde of London, master in chirurgerie, by John Norton, 1597.
  - Botanical watercolours by Ellen Arabella Whinfield, 1835-1884.
  - Our edible toadstools and mushrooms and how to distinguish them; a selection of thirty native food varieties, easily recognizable by their marked individualities, with simple rules for the identification of poisonous species, by W. Hamilton Gibson, 1895.

This collection of images is significant because most of them have not been digitized. Many of the names are not included with the illustration or are simply outdated so I have identified them and listed them as their current taxonomic names so as to portray them more accurately to current scientific standards. I have listed the printing method for each illustration, as well. There are no artists listed for The herball as woodcuts generally do not have an artistâ€™s signature.

I used these sources to identify the mushrooms and fungi:
